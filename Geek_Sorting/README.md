# Array-logics

The program is about sorting.
 
We are given two arrays. We need to sort the values of one array using the second array...

Few test conditions are given below:

 Input:   
 
         array1 = {"a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i"};
         
         array2 = {0,1,1,0,1,2,2,0,1};
         
 Output:
 
         array3 = {"a","d","h","b","c","e","i","f","g"};         
         


 Input:
 
         array1 = {"g","e","e","k","s","f","o","r","g"."e","e","k","s"};
         
         array2 = {0,1,1,0,1,2,2,0,1};
         
         
 Output:
 
         array3 = {"g","k","r","e","e","s","g","f","o"};
